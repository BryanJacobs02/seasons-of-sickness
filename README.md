# Mapping the Seasons of Sickness: Geographic and Seasonal Trends in U.S. Disease Incidence
*Final project for [INFO 511: Foundations of Data Science](https://infosci.arizona.edu/course/info-511-foundations-data-science) â€” University of Arizona*
  
  
## Project Intro/Objective
This project used Python to analyze disease risk trends across the U.S. by season and location, leveraging logistic regression, geovisualization, and time series analysis. Results from a project of this sort are vital for officials to make proper decisions regarding public health.
  
## Dataset
The HealthData.gov dataset used for this project can be accessed using the following link:
- [Dataset Link](https://healthdata.gov/dataset/Project-Tycho-Level-1-Data/g89t-x93h/about_data)  
*Due to the size of the dataset, the `.csv` is not located in this repository.*
